# Tumor-Heterogeneity: Machine Learning

The PyTorch implementation of VAEs and GANs for generating reconstructions/realizations of virtual patient tumor cell densities can be found in TumorVAE.ipynb and TumorGAN.ipynb respectively. These notebooks call various functions from the Models and Utils folders. The Models folder contains codes that build encoder and decoder neural network architectures that are used in VAEs and GANs. The Utils folder contains helper codes. In particular, ModelWrapper.py is used to wrap around the VAE model for easy training, validation, and saving. This is not the case for GANs as the optimization procedure is more complex. The SampleGenerationNotebook contains examples of how to generate new virtual patient samples using pre-trained VAEs and GANs. Model parameters are included in the Weights folder.
