# Tumor-Heterogeneity

Tutorial code to go along with the paper:

R Everett, KB Flores, N Henscheid, J Lagergren, K Larripa, D Li, JT Nardini, PTT Nguyen, EB Pitman, EM Rutter (2020) A tutorial review of mathematical techniques for quantifying tumor heterogeneity. Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 17(4):3660-3709. http://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020207.

Each section contains code to replicate the results present in the manuscript, namely, nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NMLE), virtual populations (VPOP), Nonparametric Estimation, Bayesian Estimation, and Machine Learning - GANs and VAEs (ML). Within each folder, the requirements for running the code are stipulated including which programs may be necessary. Code is mostly written in either MATLAB or python.
