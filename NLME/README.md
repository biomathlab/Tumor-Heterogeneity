# Tumor-Heterogeneity: Nonlinear Mixed Effects (NLME)

The code in this section was written in MATLAB 2019a.

The script fisher_NLME.m is used to perform NLME with the fisher-KPP model on the homogenous dataset (located in bimodal_rho_const_VP.mat). Note that this code as is takes about 4 days to run on one CPU. The output of this code (already saved in this rep) will be saved to VP_results_phi_const_D_known.mat)

The script histogram_plotting.m creates the histogram plot generated in Figure 5. This will create the figures NLME_plot.png and NLME_plot.fig


the script KS_NLME.m performs the two-sample KS test mentioned in this section.
